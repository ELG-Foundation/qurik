# üöÄ Qurik Blade UI Kit

## Overview

This project is an early-stage development of a modern, responsive UI kit and application structure built on the Laravel framework. It leverages Blade templates for the core structure, Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, DaisyUI for pre-styled components, and Livewire for dynamic, interactive functionality without writing complex JavaScript.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This project is currently in active, early development. Expect frequent additions, removals, and refactoring as the design patterns and component library evolve.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Setup
